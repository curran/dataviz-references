Most common feedback on works in bl.ocks.org:

 * The URL is there in the README, but it's not a link. Please make it a link using this syntax: `[I'm a link](http://google.com)`
 * The original visualization is not cited (so as it stands this could be considered plagiarism). Please add a link to the original visualization that was copied from.
 * The data source is not linked. Please add a link to the data source.
 * The visualization goes off the screen at the bottom. To fix this, you can add a .block YML file by clicking the ".block" tab in Blockbuilder, and setting the iFrame height.
 * The thumbnail image is missing. Please add a thumbnail by either taking a screenshot and using Blockbuilder to add the thumbnail image, or use [gist-snap](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gist-snap) (clone the Gist using Git, run gist-snap, `git add .`, then `git commit -m "Snap!"`, then `git push`).

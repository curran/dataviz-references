Most common feedback on works in bl.ocks.org:

 * The URL is there in the README, but it's not a link. Please make it a correct link using this syntax: `[I'm a link](http://google.com)`
 * The original visualization is not cited (so as it stands this could be considered plagiarism). Please add a link to the original visualization that was copied from.
 * The data source is not linked. Please add a link to the data source.
 * The visualization goes off the screen at the bottom. To fix this, you can add a .block YML file by clicking the ".block" tab in Blockbuilder, and setting the iFrame height.
